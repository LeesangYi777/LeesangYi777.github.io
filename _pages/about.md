<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am **Xuanyi Li (李宣颐)**, an undergraduate student at the **School of Statistics, Renmin University of China**, where I have been pursuing a **dual major in Applied Economics and Data Science** since 2023.

My academic interests lie at the intersection of **data science, natural language processing (NLP), and large language models (LLMs)**, with a particular focus on their applications in **economic systems and data markets**. I am especially interested in how data sharing, privacy, and strategic behavior interact in multi-agent environments, and how LLMs can be used both as decision-makers and as tools for simulating complex economic mechanisms.

Currently, my research concentrates on **benchmarking LLM decision-making** in data market settings, including scenarios involving privacy externalities, platform pricing, and strategic data disclosure. Through simulation-based experiments and theoretical baselines, I aim to understand when and how LLM-driven agents deviate from rational economic predictions, and what implications this has for market efficiency and welfare.
